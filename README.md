# GreenMO-PhaseShifter
This repo contains the codes and the report for ECE257B winter 2024 project entitled "Green downlink communication via replacing physical RF chains with virtual ones inspired by GreenMO uplink architecture".
The "Math Simulation" folder gives the result for mathematical simulation, and "OFDM-MIMO Simulation" folder generates the results for OFDM-MIMO simulation. FOr the second result, just the main.m file should be used.
